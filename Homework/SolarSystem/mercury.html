                Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun
                takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. <br>
                It is named after the Roman god Mercurius
                (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding
                to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς).
                <br>Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior
                planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°.
                <br>This proximity to
                the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon
                before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is
                more difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range
                of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116
                days.

                Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2
                spin–orbit resonance,[17] meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three
                times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.[a][18] As seen from the Sun, in a frame of
                reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian
                years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.
                <br>The ancients knew Mercury by different names depending on whether it was an evening star or a
                morning star. By about 350 BC, the ancient Greeks had realized the two stars were one.[23] They knew the
                planet as Στίλβων Stilbōn, meaning "twinkling", and Ἑρμής Hermēs, for its fleeting motion,[24] a name
                that is retained in modern Greek (Ερμής Ermis).[25] The Romans named the planet after the swift-footed
                Roman messenger god, Mercury (Latin Mercurius), which they equated with the Greek Hermes, because it
                moves across the sky faster than any other planet.[23][26] The astronomical symbol for Mercury is a
                stylized version of Hermes' caduceus; a Christian cross was added in the 16th century:

                Mercury has the most eccentric orbit of all the planets in the Solar System; its eccentricity is 0.21
                with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46,000,000 to 70,000,000 km (29,000,000 to 43,000,000 mi).
                It takes 87.969 Earth days to complete an orbit. The diagram illustrates the effects of the
                eccentricity, showing Mercury's orbit overlaid with a circular orbit having the same semi-major axis.
                Mercury's higher velocity when it is near perihelion is clear from the greater distance it covers in
                each 5-day interval. In the diagram, the varying distance of Mercury to the Sun is represented by the
                size of the planet, which is inversely proportional to Mercury's distance from the Sun.
                <br> This varying
                distance to the Sun leads to Mercury's surface being flexed by tidal bulges raised by the Sun that are
                about 17 times stronger than the Moon's on Earth.[105] Combined with a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance of the
                planet's rotation around its axis, it also results in complex variations of the surface temperature.[29]
                The resonance makes a single solar day (the length between two meridian transits of the Sun) on Mercury
                last exactly two Mercury years, or about 176 Earth days.
                <br>
                At certain points on Mercury's surface, an observer would be able to see the Sun peek up a little more
                than two-thirds of the way over the horizon, then reverse and set before rising again, all within the
                same Mercurian day.[c] <br>This is because approximately four Earth days before perihelion, Mercury's
                angular orbital velocity equals its angular rotational velocity so that the Sun's apparent motion
                ceases; closer to perihelion, Mercury's angular orbital velocity then exceeds the angular rotational
                velocity. Thus, to a hypothetical observer on Mercury, the Sun appears to move in a retrograde
                direction. Four Earth days after perihelion, the Sun's normal apparent motion resumes.[29] A similar
                effect would have occurred if Mercury had been in synchronous rotation: the alternating gain and loss of
                rotation over revolution would have caused a libration of 23.65° in longitude
