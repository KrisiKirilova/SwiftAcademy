                Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the
                brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible
                to the naked eye in broad daylight.[18][19] Venus's orbit is smaller than that of Earth, but its maximal
                elongation is 47°, and thus it can be seen not only near the Sun in the morning or evening, but also a
                couple of hours before or after sunrise or sunset, depending on the observer's latitude and on the
                positions of Venus and the Sun. Most of the time, it can be seen either in the morning or in the
                evening. At some times, it may even be seen a while in a completely dark sky. Venus orbits the Sun every
                224.7 Earth days.[20] It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of
                243 Earth days. As a consequence, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the
                Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means that the Sun rises
                from its western horizon and sets in its east.[21] Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it
                shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System
                <br>Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their
                similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in
                other respects.<br>It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more
                than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea
                level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though
                Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a
                mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective
                clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in light. It may have had
                water oceans in the past,[23][24] but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose under a runaway
                greenhouse effect.[25] The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept
                into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field.
                <br>
                In 1967, Venera 4 found Venus's magnetic field to be much weaker than that of Earth. This magnetic field
                is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind,[112][113] rather than by an
                internal dynamo as in the Earth's core. Venus's small induced magnetosphere provides negligible
                protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation.

                <br>The lack of an intrinsic magnetic field at Venus was surprising, given that it is similar to Earth
                in
                size and was expected also to contain a dynamo at its core. A dynamo requires three things: a conducting
                liquid, rotation, and convection. The core is thought to be electrically conductive and, although its
                rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo.[114][115]
                This implies that the dynamo is missing because of a lack of convection in Venus's core. On Earth,
                convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much
                higher in temperature than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate
                tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This insulating effect would cause the
                mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal
                geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the core is reheating the
                crust.[116]

                <br>One possibility is that Venus has no solid inner core,[117] or that its core is not cooling, so that
                the
                entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature. Another possibility is that its
                core has already completely solidified. The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration
                of sulfur, which is unknown at present.[116]

                Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0.72 AU (108 million km; 67 million mi), and
                completes an orbit every 224.7 days. Although all planetary orbits are elliptical, Venus's orbit is
                currently the closest to circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.01.[5] Simulations of the early
                solar system orbital dynamics have shown that the eccentricity of the Venus orbit may have been
                substantially larger in the past, reaching values as high as 0.31 and possibly impacting the early
                climate evolution.[121] The current near-circular orbit of Venus means that when Venus lies between
                Earth and the Sun in inferior conjunction, it makes the closest approach to Earth of any planet at an
                average distance of 41 million km (25 million mi).[5][n 2][122] The planet reaches inferior conjunction
                every 584 days, on average.[5] Because of the decreasing eccentricity of Earth's orbit, the minimum
                distances will become greater over tens of thousands of years. From the year 1 to 5383, there are 526
                approaches less than 40 million km; then there are none for about 60,158 years.[123]
                <br>All the planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in an anticlockwise direction as viewed from above
                Earth's north pole. Most planets also rotate on their axes in an anti-clockwise direction, but Venus
                rotates clockwise in retrograde rotation once every 243 Earth days—the slowest rotation of any planet.
                Because its rotation is so slow, Venus is very close to spherical.[124] A Venusian sidereal day thus
                lasts longer than a Venusian year (243 versus 224.7 Earth days). Venus's equator rotates at 6.52 km/h
                (4.05 mph), whereas Earth's rotates at 1,674.4 km/h (1,040.4 mph).[128][129] Venus's rotation period
                measured with Magellan spacecraft data over a 500-day period is smaller than the rotation period
                measured during the 16-year period between the Magellan spacecraft and Venus Express visits, with a
                difference of about 6.5 minutes.[130] Because of the retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on
                Venus is significantly shorter than the sidereal day, at 116.75 Earth days (making the Venusian solar
                day shorter than Mercury's 176 Earth days — the 116-day figure is extremely close to the average number
                of days it takes Mercury to slip underneath the Earth in its orbit).[11] One Venusian year is about 1.92
                Venusian solar days.[131] To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set
                in the east,[131] although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface
