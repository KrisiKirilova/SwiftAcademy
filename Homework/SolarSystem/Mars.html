                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger
                than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as
                the "Red Planet".[17][18] The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface,
                which gives it a striking reddish appearance in the sky.[19] Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin
                atmosphere, with surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps.

                The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotation period as well as the tilt
                of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the
                largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris,
                one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere
                covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature.[20] Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos,
                which are small and irregularly shaped.

                Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft. Mariner 4 was the first spacecraft to visit Mars;
                launched by NASA on 28 November 1964, it made its closest approach to the planet on 15 July 1965.
                Mariner 4 detected the weak Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earth, and captured
                the first images of another planet from deep space.[21] The latest spacecraft to successfully land on
                Mars are CNSA's Tianwen-1 lander and Zhurong rover, landed on 14 May 2021.[22] The Zhurong rover was
                successfully deployed on 22 May 2021, which makes China the second country to successfully deploy a
                rover on Mars, after the United States.[22]

                There are investigations assessing the past habitability of Mars, as well as the possibility of extant
                life. Astrobiology missions are planned, such as the European Space Agency's Rosalind Franklin
                rover.[23][24] Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which
                is less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth.[25][26] Both of Mars's polar ice caps appear to be
                made largely of water.[27][28]

                Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent
                magnitude reaches âˆ’2.94, which is surpassed only by Venus, the Moon and the Sun.[12] Optical
                ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about 300 kilometres (190 mi) across
                when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth's atmosphere.[29]

                Mars is named after the Roman god of war. This association between Mars and war dates back at least to
                Babylonian astronomy, in which the planet was named for the god Nergal, deity of war and
                destruction.[270][271] It persisted into modern times, as exemplified by Gustav Holst's orchestral suite
                The Planets, whose famous first movement labels Mars "the bringer of war".[272] The planet's symbol, a
                circle with an spear pointing out to the upper right, is also used as a symbol for the male gender.[273]
                The symbol dates from at latest the 11th century, though a possible predecessor has been found in the
                Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri.[274]

                The idea that Mars was populated by intelligent Martians became widespread in the late 19th century.
                Schiaparelli's "canali" observations combined with Percival Lowell's books on the subject put forward
                the standard notion of a planet that was a drying, cooling, dying world with ancient civilizations
                constructing irrigation works.[275] Many other observations and proclamations by notable personalities
                added to what has been termed "Mars Fever".[276] High-resolution mapping of the surface of Mars revealed
                no artifacts of habitation, but pseudoscientific speculation about intelligent life on Mars still
                continues. Reminiscent of the canali observations, these speculations are based on small scale features
                perceived in the spacecraft images, such as "pyramids" and the "Face on Mars".[277] In his book Cosmos,
                planetary astronomer Carl Sagan wrote: "Mars has become a kind of mythic arena onto which we have
                projected our Earthly hopes and fears."
                <br>
                The depiction of Mars in fiction has been stimulated by its dramatic red color and by nineteenth-century
                scientific speculations that its surface conditions might support not just life but intelligent
                life.[278] This gave way to many science fiction stories involving these concepts, such as H. G. Wells'
                The War of the Worlds, in which Martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading Earth, Ray
                Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles, in which human explorers accidentally destroy a Martian civilization,
                as well as Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom series, C. S. Lewis' novel Out of the Silent Planet
                (1938),[279] and a number of Robert A. Heinlein stories before the mid-sixties.[280] Since then,
                depictions of Martians have also extended to animation. A comic figure of an intelligent Martian, Marvin
                the Martian, appeared in Haredevil Hare (1948) as a character in the Looney Tunes animated cartoons of
                Warner Brothers, and has continued as part of popular culture to the present.[281] After the Mariner and
                Viking spacecraft had returned pictures of Mars as it really is, a lifeless and canal-less world, these
                ideas about Mars were abandoned; for many science-fiction authors, the new discoveries initially seemed
                like a constraint, but eventually the post-Viking knowledge of Mars became itself a source of
                inspiration for works like Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy.[282]
