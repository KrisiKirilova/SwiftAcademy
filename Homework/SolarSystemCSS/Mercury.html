            Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun
            takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. <br>
            It is named after the Roman god Mercurius
            (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding
            to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς).
            <br>
            <br>Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior
            planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°.
            This proximity to
            the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon
            before sunrise, usually in twilight.
            <br>
            <br>At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is
            more difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range
            of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116
            days.

            Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2
            spin–orbit resonance,[17] meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three
            times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame of
            reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian
            years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.
            <br>
            <br>The ancients knew Mercury by different names depending on whether it was an evening star or a
            morning star. By about 350 BC, the ancient Greeks had realized the two stars were one.They knew the
            planet as Στίλβων Stilbōn, meaning "twinkling", and Ἑρμής Hermēs, for its fleeting motion,[24] a name
            that is retained in modern Greek (Ερμής Ermis).The Romans named the planet after the swift-footed
            Roman messenger god, Mercury (Latin Mercurius), which they equated with the Greek Hermes, because it
            moves across the sky faster than any other planet.[23][26] The astronomical symbol for Mercury is a
            stylized version of Hermes' caduceus; a Christian cross was added in the 16th century:
            <br>
            <br>
            Mercury has the most eccentric orbit of all the planets in the Solar System; its eccentricity is 0.21
            with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46,000,000 to 70,000,000 km (29,000,000 to 43,000,000 mi).
            It takes 87.969 Earth days to complete an orbit. The diagram illustrates the effects of the
            eccentricity, showing Mercury's orbit overlaid with a circular orbit having the same semi-major axis.
            Mercury's higher velocity when it is near perihelion is clear from the greater distance it covers in
            each 5-day interval.<br> In the diagram, the varying distance of Mercury to the Sun is represented by the
            size of the planet, which is inversely proportional to Mercury's distance from the Sun.
            <br> This varying
            distance to the Sun leads to Mercury's surface being flexed by tidal bulges raised by the Sun that are
            about 17 times stronger than the Moon's on Earth.[105] Combined with a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance of the
            planet's rotation around its axis, it also results in complex variations of the surface temperature.[29]
            <br>
            The resonance makes a single solar day (the length between two meridian transits of the Sun) on Mercury
            last exactly two Mercury years, or about 176 Earth days.
            <br>
            At certain points on Mercury's surface, an observer would be able to see the Sun peek up a little more
            than two-thirds of the way over the horizon, then reverse and set before rising again, all within the
            same Mercurian day.[c] <br>
            <br>
            This is because approximately four Earth days before perihelion, Mercury's angular orbital velocity equals
            its angular rotational velocity so that the Sun's apparent motion ceases; closer to perihelion, Mercury's
            angular orbital velocity then exceeds the angular rotational velocity. Thus, to a hypothetical observer on
            Mercury, the Sun appears to move in a retrograde direction. Four Earth days after perihelion, the Sun's
            normal apparent motion resumes.[29] A similar effect would have occurred if Mercury had been in synchronous
            rotation: the alternating gain and loss of rotation over revolution would have caused a libration of 23.65°
            in longitude
