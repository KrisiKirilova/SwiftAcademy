            Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger
            than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as
            the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface,
            which gives it a striking reddish appearance in the sky. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin
            atmosphere, with surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps.
            The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotation period as well as the tilt
            of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the
            largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris,
            one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere
            covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos,
            which are small and irregularly shaped.
            Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft. Mariner 4 was the first spacecraft to visit Mars;
            launched by NASA on 28 November 1964, it made its closest approach to the planet on 15 July 1965.
            Mariner 4 detected the weak Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earth, and captured
            the first images of another planet from deep space.The latest spacecraft to successfully land on
            Mars are CNSA's Tianwen-1 lander and Zhurong rover, landed on 14 May 2021. The Zhurong rover was
            successfully deployed on 22 May 2021, which makes China the second country to successfully deploy a
            rover on Mars, after the United States.
            There are investigations assessing the past habitability of Mars, as well as the possibility of extant
            life. Astrobiology missions are planned, such as the European Space Agency's Rosalind Franklin
            rover.Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which
            is less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth.Both of Mars's polar ice caps appear to be
            made largely of water.
            Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent
            magnitude reaches âˆ’2.94, which is surpassed only by Venus, the Moon and the Sun. Optical
            ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about 300 kilometres (190 mi) across
            when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth's atmosphere.

        <p> Mars is named after the Roman god of war. This association between Mars and war dates back at least to
            Babylonian astronomy, in which the planet was named for the god Nergal, deity of war and
            destruction. It persisted into modern times, as exemplified by Gustav Holst's orchestral suite
            The Planets, whose famous first movement labels Mars "the bringer of war".<br>
            The planet's symbol, a
            circle with an spear pointing out to the upper right, is also used as a symbol for the male gender.
            The symbol dates from at latest the 11th century, though a possible predecessor has been found in the
            Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri.
            The idea that Mars was populated by intelligent Martians became widespread in the late 19th century.
            Schiaparelli's "canali" observations combined with Percival Lowell's books on the subject put forward
            the standard notion of a planet that was a drying, cooling, dying world with ancient civilizations
            constructing irrigation works.
            <br>
            <br>Many other observations and proclamations by notable personalities
            added to what has been termed "Mars Fever". High-resolution mapping of the surface of Mars revealed
            no artifacts of habitation, but pseudoscientific speculation about intelligent life on Mars still
            continues. Reminiscent of the canali observations, these speculations are based on small scale features
            perceived in the spacecraft images, such as "pyramids" and the "Face on Mars". In his book Cosmos,
            planetary astronomer Carl Sagan wrote: "Mars has become a kind of mythic arena onto which we have
            projected our Earthly hopes and fears."
            <br>
            The depiction of Mars in fiction has been stimulated by its dramatic red color and by nineteenth-century
            scientific speculations that its surface conditions might support not just life but intelligent
            life.
            <br>
            <br>This gave way to many science fiction stories involving these concepts, such as H. G. Wells'
            The War of the Worlds, in which Martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading Earth, Ray
            Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles, in which human explorers accidentally destroy a Martian civilization,
            as well as Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom series, C. S. Lewis' novel Out of the Silent Planet
            (1938),and a number of Robert A. Heinlein stories before the mid-sixties. <br>Since then,
            depictions of Martians have also extended to animation. A comic figure of an intelligent Martian, Marvin
            the Martian, appeared in Haredevil Hare (1948) as a character in the Looney Tunes animated cartoons of
            Warner Brothers, and has continued as part of popular culture to the present.After the Mariner and
            Viking spacecraft had returned pictures of Mars as it really is, a lifeless and canal-less world, these
            ideas about Mars were abandoned; for many science-fiction authors, the new discoveries initially seemed
            like a constraint, but eventually the post-Viking knowledge of Mars became itself a source of
            inspiration for works like Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy.
